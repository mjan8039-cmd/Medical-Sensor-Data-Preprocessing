# Medical-Sensor-Data-Preprocessing
 This project develops an original preprocessing pipeline for numerical medical sensor data inspired by recent wearable health research. Using a public HRV dataset, the workflow handles missing values, detects outliers, scales features reduces noise and applies PCA to improve data quality for machine learning models
