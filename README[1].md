# Medical Sensor Data Preprocessing

## Project Overview
This project implements an original preprocessing pipeline for numerical medical sensor data using the HRV dataset from UCI. The workflow handles missing values, removes outliers, scales features, reduces noise, and applies PCA to improve data quality for machine learning models.

## How to Run
Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the pipeline:
```
python src/preprocessing_pipeline.py
```
