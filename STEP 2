Dataset Acquisition & Description

Dataset Source:
The dataset used for this project is the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) dataset, publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Rate+Variability](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Rate+Variability)

Brief Dataset Description:
The HRV dataset contains numerical measurements collected from human subjects using medical sensors. Heart Rate Variability is a measure of the variation in time intervals between consecutive heartbeats and is widely used in cardiovascular research and wearable health monitoring. The dataset provides standard time-domain and frequency-domain HRV features, which can be used to analyze autonomic nervous system activity and overall heart health.

Total Number of Samples:
100 samples, each corresponding to one individual measurement set.

Number of Numerical Features:
5 numerical features:

1. HR_mean – Mean heart rate
2. SDNN – Standard deviation of NN intervals
3. RMSSD – Root mean square of successive differences
4. pNN50 – Percentage of differences between adjacent NN intervals exceeding 50 ms
5. LF/HF – Ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency components

Type of Numerical Data:
All features are continuous numerical values, derived from time-series heart rate measurements. The data represents biomedical experimental readings obtained from sensors.

Suitability for Preprocessing Experimentation:
This dataset is ideal for testing and demonstrating preprocessing techniques because:

* It contains missing values and noise, which require interpolation and robust imputation methods.
* The features have different scales and distributions, allowing for meaningful feature scaling and normalization experiments.
* Sensor errors and extreme values create outliers, enabling testing of isolation forests or other outlier detection methods.
* Correlated features make it suitable for dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

In summary, the HRV dataset provides a realistic biomedical sensor dataset that is small enough for experimentation but complex enough to demonstrate robust preprocessing pipelines, making it perfectly aligned with the goals of this project.
