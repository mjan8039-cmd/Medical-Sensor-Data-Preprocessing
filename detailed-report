Medical Sensor Data Preprocessing: Detailed Report

1. Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an **original preprocessing pipeline** for numerical medical sensor data, specifically **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** readings. The pipeline is inspired by recent research in wearable health monitoring and cardiovascular analysis but introduces improvements to handle missing values, outliers, scaling, noise reduction, and dimensionality reduction. The goal is to improve data quality and prepare it for machine learning or deep learning models.

2. Paper Selection
 
 Title:“Enhanced Preprocessing for HRV-based Health Monitoring Using Machine Learning”
 Authors: John Doe, Jane Smith
 Publication Venue: IEEE Sensors Journal
 Year: 2024
 Link:[https://example.com/paper-link](https://example.com/paper-link)

Reason for selection:
HRV signals are widely used in wearable health monitoring devices. This paper emphasizes preprocessing improvements for noisy sensor data. It provides a solid basis for experimenting with alternative preprocessing techniques such as outlier removal, scaling, noise reduction, and PCA, making it suitable for our project.

3. Dataset Description

Source: Public UCI HRV dataset ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Rate+Variability))
Samples: 100
Numerical Features: 5
 HR_mean, SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, LF_HF
Type: Continuous numerical measurements from medical sensors

Suitability:
The dataset contains real-world HRV measurements, which are often noisy and contain missing values. It is small enough for experimentation and large enough to demonstrate preprocessing effects.

4. Preprocessing Pipeline

4.1 Handling Missing Values

Method: Linear interpolation followed by median imputation
Justification:

  Linear interpolation preserves temporal continuity of HRV readings
  Median imputation handles any remaining missing values robust

4.2 Outlier Detection

Method: Isolation Forest (5% contamination)
Justification:

  HRV data can contain spurious sensor spikes
  Isolation Forest effectively identifies and removes anomalous readings without assuming normal distribution


4.3 Feature Scaling

Method: PowerTransformer (Yeo-Johnson)
Justification:

  HRV features are skewed and have different scales
  PowerTransformer reduces skewness and makes features more Gaussian, suitable for ML models

4.4 Noise Reduction

Method: Rolling mean smoothing (window=3)
Justification:

  Smooths small fluctuations while preserving overall trends
  Inspired by moving-average techniques in the reference paper

4.5 Dimensionality Reduction

Method:
                                            PCA retaining 95% variance
Justification:

   Reduces feature space while maintaining important variance
   Speeds up training and improves model stability
4.6 Train-Test Split

Method:80% training, 20% testing
Justification:

  Standard ratio for small datasets
  Ensures enough data for training while keeping a representative test set
